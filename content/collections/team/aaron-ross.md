bio: |-
  Aaron joined the team in April and has already made a remarkable impact. Many of the improvements discussed in this blog, including clearly defined roles and team structure, as well as our newly developed incident management process can be traced directly to his influence.

  With over a decade of experience at COLT Telecom in London, along with managing a web design company, and serving as General Manager for an MS SharePoint & Teams business (among other senior operations roles), Aaron brings a wealth of expertise. This background equips him to effectively lead the Wholesale & Customer Success Team, as well as our Helpdesk, ensuring our support remains cohesive and comprehensive. His work touches every part of the business, making sure every interaction with Voyager is positive, no matter the circumstances under which support is needed.
