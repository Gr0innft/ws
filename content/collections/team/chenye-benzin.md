  Joining Voyager in 2024 as Service Delivery Manager before moving into her current role, Chenye brings operational know-how and a strong understanding of the processes, people, and operations that drive wholesale success. Her time at Chorus and other service partners has built both technical expertise with in-depth knowledge of connectivity, fibre networks, systems, and industry.

  She focuses on creating smooth partner experiences, reducing friction in processes, resolving issues quickly, and making sure partners have direct access to Voyager’s technical resources so they can grow their business with confidence. She knows the importance of timely, reliable support, and feedback from our wholesale partners already confirms that she’s delivering exactly that.
