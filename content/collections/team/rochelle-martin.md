  Rochelle has been with Voyager since 2015, celebrating a decade with the company. With over 20 years total in the ICT industry, her career has spanned sales and management roles at Zintel Communications, Orcon Internet, and Adhesion, which in turn has equipped her with a strong understanding of the telco sector, voice technology, customer acquisition, solution delivery, and marketing.

  Drawing on this experience, Rochelle understands the challenges and priorities of our Wholesale Partners. She makes it her mission to make doing business with Voyager as simple as possible. Rochelle takes the time to step into each partner’s world, recognizing that every business is unique, with its own strengths, limitations, and future goals, and identifying how Voyager can help them get there. Rochelle sees herself as a trusted extension of her partners’ team, and someone who genuinely invested in their success, demonstrating true partnership.
