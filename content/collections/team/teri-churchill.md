  Terry has been with Voyager since 2024, bringing a wealth of experience as a seasoned telco professional. His career includes years at Spark NZ, where he worked across customer care, deployment, sales, and account management teams. He’s also been on the other side of the table—working for a wholesaler—where he applied his expertise to deliver tailored communication solutions for the business.

  At Voyager, Terry specialises in helping wholesalers with Voice configurations and deployments, Fibre broadband connections, and a wide range of general and technical inquiries. His main drivers are to make Voyager easy to do business with and to equip wholesalers with the knowledge and skills to get the most from Voyager’s systems, ensuring they can deliver exceptional service to their own customers.
