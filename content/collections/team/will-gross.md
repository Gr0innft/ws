bio: |-
  For Will Gross, our newest addition to the Wholesale team, stepping into the Senior Customer Success Manager role was a natural progression. With experience in fast-paced, people-first roles, from emergency services to technical support and customer care, he joined Voyager as a Support Analyst, handling everything from broadband to domains over the past two years. In support, he managed escalations, worked closely with provisioning, engineering, and sales, and contributed to documentation and process improvements, building a strong foundation in telco and wholesale.

  Now, Will focuses on ensuring wholesale partners receive clear, timely support when it matters most. He prioritises communication, takes ownership of outcomes, and makes sure people feel supported, even when challenges arise. Known for following through, representing partner needs internally, and building long-term confidence in our solutions, Will’s role is built on trust, both within Voyager and with the wholesalers he supports.
